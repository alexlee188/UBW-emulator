The UBW Emulator firmware is for PIC devices such as the 18F2550 based UBW or PIC32MX460F512L based UBW32.

It provides a USB to I2C interface to control ham radio hardware such as the Softrock or UHFSDR.

It 'emulates' the firmware written by Fred Krom for the AVR uController used in the USB-I2C interface.
